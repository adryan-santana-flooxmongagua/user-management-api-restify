# **User Management API - Restify**

## **Description**  
This repository contains the source code for a user management API developed using Node.js and Restify. The project focuses on building a simple yet efficient RESTful API for user management, implementing key concepts such as routing, middleware, and data handling.

## **Project Objectives**  
- Develop a RESTful API using Node.js and Restify.
- Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for user management.
- Handle HTTP requests and responses effectively.
- Apply middleware for logging, error handling, and request validation.
- Structure the project using best practices for maintainability.

## **Implemented Features**  
### **Core Features**  
- **User Registration:** API endpoints for creating new user records.
- **User Retrieval:** Fetch user data by ID or list all users.
- **User Update:** Modify user information via API requests.
- **User Deletion:** Remove users from the database.
- **Middleware Implementation:** Includes logging, validation, and error handling.

### **Enhancements**  
- **Request Validation:** Ensures only valid data is accepted.
- **Error Handling:** Returns meaningful error messages for invalid requests.
- **Logging:** Implements request logging for debugging and monitoring.
- **Modular Structure:** Organized codebase for scalability and maintainability.

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side execution.
- **Restify:** Lightweight framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **Middleware:** Used for logging, validation, and error handling.
- **JSON Data Storage:** Stores user data in JSON format (or integrates with a database, if applicable).

## **Why did I do this project?**  
This repository serves as a practical exercise in building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Restify. The main goal was to apply backend development concepts, improve API design skills, and gain hands-on experience with middleware and request handling.

## **Notice**  
This project is still in development and contains some bugs that need to be fixed. Future updates will focus on improving stability and resolving known issues.

### **Status**  
**In Progress!** The project is not yet finalized, and bug fixes are ongoing.
