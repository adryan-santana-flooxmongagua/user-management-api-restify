# **User Management System**

## **Description**  
This repository contains the source code for a user management system developed in JavaScript. The project explores fundamental language concepts, DOM manipulation, localStorage, sessionStorage, event handling, and programming logic using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

## **Project Objectives**  
- Implement a functional user management system using JavaScript.
- Learn and practice event handling with the DOM.
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
- Use sessionStorage and localStorage for data persistence.
- Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## **Implemented Features**  
### **Core Features**  
- **Form Handling:** Implementation of a form to dynamically collect user data.
- **Event Management:** Handling user interactions with multiple event listeners.
- **Data Management:** Using JavaScript objects to structure and store data.

### **Enhancements**  
- **Editing Functionality:** Allowed users to modify existing data, including radio and checkbox selections.
- **Image Handling:** Used FileReader to retain images when editing user data.
- **Keyboard Support:** Enabled keyboard events to improve user interaction.
- **Copy & Paste:** Implemented clipboard operations to facilitate data management.
- **Audio Feedback:** Added sound effects to enhance interface responsiveness.
- **Display Optimization:** Defined a maximum value for the display to prevent overflow.
- **Validation Improvements:** Fixed form validation issues and refined logic.

### **Data Persistence**  
- **SessionStorage Implementation:** Stores temporary data to maintain user information during the session.
- **LocalStorage Integration:** Ensures data remains available between sessions.
- **Use of Object.assign:** Fixed localStorage updates by correctly merging objects.
- **Delete Functionality:** Enabled data removal from localStorage.

## **Why did I do this project?**  
This repository serves as a record of practical JavaScript implementations I worked on, applying essential concepts such as event-driven programming, data persistence, and MVC architecture.

## **Notice**  
This project was developed as part of my JavaScript learning journey. The main goal was to document and consolidate knowledge through hands-on implementations.

**Important:** This repository is not a continuously evolving project but serves as a reference for explored techniques and best practices.

### **Status**  
**Completed!** The project has been finalized, and no further updates are planned at this time.
